# Project README

This repository contains several files related to the analysis and visualization of wine data. Below is a brief description of each file:

- `wiwino.db`: This is the database containing the wine data used for analysis.
  
- `queries.sql`: This file contains SQL queries for extracting and manipulating data from the `wiwino.db` database. For optimal usage, it's recommended to open `queries.sql` in a SQL notebook extension, such as the one available in Visual Studio Code.

- `graphs.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains code for generating graphs and visualizations based on the data in `wiwino.db`. 

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the dependencies required to run the code in `graphs.ipynb`.

- `results.pptx`: This PowerPoint file contains the final presentation or results derived from the analysis and visualizations.

- `vintage_ratings.csv`: A CSV file containing vintage ratings data used for the graphs.

- `wine_ratings.csv`: A CSV file containing wine ratings data used for the graphs.
